## LC Circuit Simulation

Our project is an LC circuit simulation, coded in NetLogo. The user can input values for the voltage, the capacitance, and the inductance in the circuit. Then, press the "setup" button. The circuit will appear, and the switch will be on "on" which means that the battery charges up the capacitor. Then, press the "go" button. Now the user can flip the switch to "off" and the circuit switch will be flipped such that now the inductor and capacitor are connected. 
  The magnetic field will appear around the circuit as the electrons start moving from one plate capacitor to the other. A graph displays both the instantaneous current in the circuit and the charge on the plates. When all of the charge transfers to the other plate, then the visibly current switches directions and the magnetic field does, too.
  Our project demonstrates how an inductor will create an induced magnetic field to oppose a change in current, which in the case of an LC circuit results in an oscillating current.
